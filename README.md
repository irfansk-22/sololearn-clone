# SOLOLEARN Clone

The landing page clone of sololearn's website look's very similar to it (previous version, they have updated their UI).

> SOLOLEARN is a great resource to learn to code for free any time anywhere in your mobile, pc or desktop. They also provide certificates when you complete one of their course and a great thing about the courses on sololearn is they have nice comment section which is really helpful.
